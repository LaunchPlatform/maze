# MAZE
MAZE (Massive Argumented Zonal Environments) machine learning framework

This is a machine learning framework plus a research pet project aimed at generating neuron network models based on genes of agents merging and mutating in a series of controlled environments.

Neuron networks evolve organically in MAZE, so they come in with different strange shapes, here are some interesting ones:
