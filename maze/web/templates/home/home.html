# MAZE
MAZE (Massive Argumented Zonal Environments) machine learning framework

This is a machine learning framework plus a research pet project aimed at generating neuron network models based on genes of agents merging and mutating in a series of controlled environments.

Please read the articles we published to learn more:

- [Article00 - How I would build AGI](https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2025/02/06/maze-how-i-would-build-agi/)
- [Article01 - My AI models are finally evolving!](http://fangpenlin.com/posts/2025/02/18/maze-my-ai-models-are-finally-evolving/)

# Getting started

You can click experiments on the left-hand side menu to explore the experiment and the agents in it.
This is an open-source project, you can also find the source code on GitHub:

# Gallery

Neuron networks evolve organically in MAZE, so they come in with different strange shapes, here are some interesting ones:
